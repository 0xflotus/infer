This section describes the Infer.NET Matchbox recommender and is split into four parts:

*   [**Introduction**](Matchbox recommender/Introduction.md) \- gives a gentle introduction to recommender systems in general and briefly explains the core principles of the Matchbox model.
*   [**Learner API**](Matchbox recommender/Learner API.md) - starts with a simple usage example of the Matchbox reocmmender and then goes in more detail on how to create the learner from a data mapping, how to save it and load it, how to change its settings, how to train it, how to make predictions, and how to evaluate those predictions.
*   [**Model**](Matchbox recommender/Model.md) \- explains the assumptions made in the Matchbox model and gives a full factor graph of the recommender.
*   [**Command-line runners**](Matchbox recommender/Command-line runners.md) \- describes how to use the Matchbox recommender from the command line.
