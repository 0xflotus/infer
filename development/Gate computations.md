## Gate computations

The computations done for model evidence and gate messages in Infer.NET follow the [gates paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/gates-a-graphical-notation-for-mixture-models/), with some improvements.  The computations have been reorganized to be more efficient in common cases.  This reorganization is explained in the paper ["Model evidence and gate messages in Infer.NET"](minka-evidence.pdf).
